## Ingredients

- 2x 9oz/250g blocks of Halloumi, diced into large chunks & patted dry
- 9oz / 250g Sweet Potato, peeled & diced into large chunks (weight AFTER peeled/diced)
- 1x 14oz/400g can of Chickpeas, drained
- 1x 14oz/400g can of Full Fat Coconut Milk
- 1 cup / 250g Tomato Passata
- 1 cup / 250ml Chicken Stock
- 3.5oz / 100g Baby Spinach
- 2-3 tbsp finely diced Fresh Coriander
- 2 tbsp Tomato Paste
- 3 cloves of Garlic, finely diced/minced
- 2 tsp Ginger, finely diced/minced
- 1 tbsp Vegetable Oil, as needed

### Spice Mix

- 1 tbsp EACH: Garam Masala, Ground Coriander
- 2 tsp EACH: Paprika, Cumin, Chilli Powder
- 1 tsp Turmeric

## Instructions

1. In a small pot or bowl combine garam masala, chilli powder, paprika, cumin, ground coriander and turmeric. Place to one side.
1. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pot or pan over medium/high heat and add in sweet potato. Fry for 3-5mins, or until it starts to lightly brown. You're not looking to cook it at this point, just brown the outside.
1. Add in halloumi and fry for another few mins until it picks up colour, then lower heat to medium. Make space in the centre of the pan and add in garlic & ginger. Fry for 1-2mins until very lightly brown. Incorporate everything together, then stir in tomato paste and fry for another 1-2mins. Sprinkle in spices, give it all a good stir and fry for a couple of mins to toast the spices.
1. Pour in chicken stock, then add coconut milk, passata and chickpeas. Give it a good stir then keep on a simmer until the sweet potato is just about cooked through and the sauce has thickened. Add in spinach and coriander and gently stir until the spinach wilts and the potato is fork tender.
1. Serve up with rice and naan. Enjoy!
