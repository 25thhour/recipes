## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt or to taste
- 1/4 teaspoon pepper or to taste
- 8 chicken thighs boneless and skinless
- 2 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 large onion chopped
- 3 cloves garlic minced
- 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 1/2 tablespoon dried oregano
- 1 tablespoon fresh thyme chopped
- 1 1/2 cups orzo dry
- 1 cup white wine
- 2 cups chicken broth low sodium
- 3/4 cup kalamata olives pitted
- 1/4 cup feta cheese crumbled
- 2 tablespoon fresh parsley chopped
- 1/2 lemon cut into wedges

## Instructions

1. In a medium sized bowl whisk together the flour, smoked paprika, garlic powder, salt and pepper.
1. Dredge the chicken thighs through the flour mixture.
1. In a large skillet, heat 1 tbsp of olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the chicken thighs and cook for about 4 minutes per side or until crispy. Don’t worry if the chicken isn’t cooked through completely. We’ll continue cooking it later. Transfer the chicken to a plate and set aside.
1. In the same skillet, add the remaining tbsp of olive oil. Add the onion, garlic, red pepper flakes, oregano, thyme and stir. Cook for about 1 minute, just until the garlic gets aromatic and the onion begins to soften a bit. - At this point you can season with a bit of salt and pepper.
1. Add the orzo to the skillet, pour in the wine, chicken broth and stir. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a medium. Add the chicken back to the skillet, cover with a lid and cook for about 10 minutes or until the orzo is cooked through, stirring occasionally.
1. Garnish with kalamata olives, feta cheese, parsley and lemon wedges.
1. Serve while warm.
